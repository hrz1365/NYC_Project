# Demographic Projections for NYC 
## Purpose
This project aims at generating cell specific demographic projections under the SSPs (currently SSP1 and SSP2) for NYC.

## Models
There are three models for this project:
1. Population projection model (multi-state cohort component model)
2. Spatial downscaling model (spatial gravity model)
3. Spatial decomposition model (LSTM deep learning model on time-series)
